                    <h5>Milk</h5>

                    <p className="dis-data">Milk is often considered as a whole meal. It is a good source of many essential nutrients, including calcium, protein, and vitamin D. Many people see it as a vital part of a balanced diet. Sources of milk and milk products include cows, sheep, camels, goats, and many others. Milk alternatives include soy milk, almond milk, flax milk, coconut milk, and hemp milk. Milk’s healthfulness depends on the individual and the type of milk they consume. Pasteurized milk that is high in protein, low in fat, and free from unnecessary additives can be healthful for many people. On the other hand, some flavored milks contain as much sugar as a can of soda. These are not a healthful choice. Present day cow’s milk is not a single product. It can be fresh or long life, fat free, lactose free, fortified with added omega-3s, hormone free, organic, or raw, among other options.</p>
                    <p className="dis-data">The nutritional breakdown of milk depends on the fat content and whether or not the manufacturer has enriched it. Nowadays, many manufacturers fortify their milk products with extra vitamins. Milk’s nutrients can benefit the body in various ways like Bone health, Brain health, Blood pressure and heart health, Depression, Muscle building and weight loss etc.

                        <h6> Which protein is best with milk? </h6>
                        <p>Bovine milk protein is considered a high-quality, or complete protein, because it contains all 9 of the essential amino acids in proportions resembling amino acid requirements. Due to the high quality of bovine milk protein, it is regarded as a standard reference protein to evaluate the nutritive value of other food proteins </p>
                        <h6> What are the disadvantages of milk?  </h6>
                        <p>Although milk may be a good choice for some, others can’t digest it or choose not to consume it. Many people can’t tolerate milk because they’re unable to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy products. If your body is not able to break down lactose properly, it travels through the digestive system and is broken down by gut bacteria. Because of this reason, gassiness and other digestive issues can happen.</p>
